Install on search heads. Use the 'decode' command afterwards.

This app adds the 'decode' command, which takes two arguments:
- field - where does the encoded data reside? (optional, defaults to _raw)
- charset (mandatory) - currently utf-8, iso-8859-1 and iso-8859-2 are supported 

Considerations:
- The encoded portions of data must preceeded by "\x" and have no spaces in between. Examples: \xc3\xa9 ; \xae
- The charset must match exactly the values above (case sensitive): utf-8, iso-8859-1, iso-8859-2. Ways to achieve this include |rex command or | eval

Syntax:
<your search> |decode field=<yourfield> charset=<utf-8|iso-8859-1|iso-8859-2>

Example:
index=myindex |stats count by message | decode field=message charset=utf-8

If the app contains charset information, this can be used with the command. Example:
_raw data: 01/01/2024 01:00:00 UTF-8 My name is Andr\xc3\xa9

Sample query:
index=myindex
| rex "\d{2}\:\d{2}\:\d{2}\s(?<mycharset>[\S]+)"
| eval mycharset=lower(mycharset)
| decode charset=mycharset
